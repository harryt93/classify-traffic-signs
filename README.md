Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Project Submission: Classify Traffic Signs

## Overview
This repository contains the code and report for a piece of coursework submitted for the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree. In this project, I build a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition dataset, and then apply my network to five new images from the internet.
